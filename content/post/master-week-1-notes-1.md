block-stacking ------------------------ cooking by taking commands from humans \
... drawing?

✏️: grounding, symbols, object+skill=effect, video, long sequence of interactions through language

## 💭 Project Philosophy 

Cultivating *self-expression* in robot. \
Similar to how children use drawing as a means of communication before they can precisely articulate their thoughts. 

🆚 self-expression through robot. \
When a person  imagines a beautiful scene and wish to see it realized on a canvas, they can communicate the ideas to the robot. 

Now thinking about the robot painting project, I first want to talk about the general motivation, like what I think is the most interesting aspect that I wish the project can explore. The idea that I wish this project can convey is slightly more philosophical rather than practical, I would say. So I think it is interesting that I can totally imagine something beautiful but not draw it out. I think execution sometimes hinders this valuable means of self-expression. I was wondering how much of this type of communication can be established between humans and robots. In this case, robots can realize the imagination of humans. How would a human describe his/her thoughts? Language.

#### Trying it out
Tap, Load .. full of paint, Work into the brush, Push paint into the fabric, Bend the brushes, Mix “some” blue, Turn brush inside, Touch, Drop

1. Hard to transfer. Require the exact colors, tools, techniques, order of application.
2. Learn some general ways of drawing things. 
3. Copy the look; spend most of the time copying the look instead of listening to the words.


## Painting with Rain
Understand the mechanism of lighting, how light reflects on surfaces, how to draw shadows on different backdrops.

draw on-off-switch, cats, cell-phones, apples, etc.  

1. I think people who can paint see the world in a different way. They have internalized the process, so it becomes very difficult to describe it. “Like you just ..” 
2. Curiosity-driven. 
“What would the ball look like before the staircase?”, “Where is the light source if the shadow looks like this?” 
3. a LOT more fun when drawing icons...

Given an input image and a blank canvas, the goal is to generate a sequence of brush strokes that will turn the canvas into a recreation of the input image… following human-like painting style.

## Ideas?
🤔 segmentation, semantic segmentation, generative modeling \
The paper that Oliver showed me [📃](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07291). \
**?** learning a distribution of what a flower looks like, but the bulk of the work would been done in terms of generating pixel-images? \
❌ not that related to manipulation
❌ not that related to language

## Thought bubble 1

Two triangles are: \
ears → cat ears \
mountains → snow mountains \
top of a pine tree → two trees by the pond \

How do humans learn about these things? \
- Hypothesis: we have seen enough (as adults). We have abstract away the knowledge, but how did we first learn draw it?
What is the psychological basis of icon / symbol formation? How would a child respond (if experience is where adults learn about icons)? Could the answer be crazier?
- [Scribbles, Labels, and Stories: The Role of Drawing in the Development of Writing ] “Drawing provides people and objects that need labels, motivating children to learn the vocabulary with which to write; it also serves as a prompt for story writing when the writer is blocked or lacks sufficient writing skills. A partnership in the development of drawing and writing is clear (see Short, Kauffmann, & Kahn 2000; Sidelnick & Svoboda 2000; Powell & Davidson 2005).”

Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction [📃](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05363)

forward model, backward model, learning to predict the effect of its own action.

- "Semiotic activity is defined here as the activity of **relating a sign and its meaning**, including the use of signs, the activity of investigating the relationship between (changes of) signs and (changes of) meaning, as well as improving the existing relationship between sign (or sign system) and meaning (or meaning system)."
