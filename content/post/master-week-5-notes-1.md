Yingshan's Annotation Template 

GMM vs. GAN

## Oct-20-Wednesday

- Questions about the "Next" button: âœ… Users label their own step. ðŸ¤” What does each **step** incorporates? One step in the drawing = Draw one primitive, label what it means.
- Oliver, Yonatan, and I all think it is fine to move towards the directiof of less-constrained drawing, since we can always "fit" to the user drawings using SVG / PNG.  
- Do we still need the primitives? Would a decision make running baseline methods difficult? 
- How to design the qualification round before actual annotations?
- Axis-aligned vs. object-aligned bounding boxes? They can used for first decising where a component is.
- "What did you just draw? What does the component mean?"
