Hi, I am a fifth-year CS master student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am co-advised by Professor [**Oliver Kroemer**](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/iam/) and Professor [**Yonatan Bisk**](https://yonatanbisk.com/). 

My current interest lies in enabling direct interaction between robot and human through language; during my master, I wish to explore how robots can form and accumulate new concepts that humans share through language. The vision of having a robot friend to grow together motivates how I frame my research questions. 

Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with Professor [**Andreas Pfenning**](http://www.pfenninglab.org/) on multi-species genome alignment. I have also spent two summers at **Uber Advanced Technologies Group** (ATG): first on the *Simulation* team and then on the *Prediction* team. 

In general, I have always been interested in studying how humans are such *efficient* learners (and really any intelligent beings, although understanding the exact mechanisms of other species is more challenging).
